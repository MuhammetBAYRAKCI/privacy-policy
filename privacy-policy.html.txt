    <p>This privacy policy explains how the mobile game <strong>Target Destroyer</strong>, developed by <strong>Muhammet BayrakcÄ±</strong>, collects, uses, and protects user data. The app is intended for all age groups, including children under the age of 13.</p>
    
    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The app does not directly collect any personal information from users. However, it uses third-party services (such as Unity Ads) that may collect the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Device ID)</li>
        <li>IP address</li>
        <li>Device type and operating system</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is used to deliver personalized ads and improve the user experience.</p>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The app uses <strong>Unity Ads</strong> to serve in-app advertisements. Unity Ads complies with privacy laws, including COPPA and Google Play policies for child-directed apps.</p>
